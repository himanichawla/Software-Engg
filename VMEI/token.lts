For HILIST and LOWLIST I am using boolean flags: 3 for HILIST and 3 for LOWLIST. True means that a
specific car is in one of the lists. Assumes I know there are 4 cars and I know their IDs. Wu does *not*
make these assumptions.

Note 1: I will have to write 4 separate WU_CAR processes for 1,2,3,4. Probably can generalize at some point.
Maybe using ID as process var and then mod operator for other car ids? Will make WAIT_RESPONSE more complicated
with nested ifs to sort out priority. I avoid this because I know car 1 is lower than everyone else.

Note 2: Treating whole grid as one non-sharable resource. Not efficient.

Note 3. I am using car id as priority. Wu uses a clock. Low id cars could get locked out under my scheme. You can
use stress testing ala the warring neighbors to show this.

Note 4. You can use stress testing to make sure time_out is long enough - make it low priority.

Note 5. I find it useful to model like this to try to sort out what Wu is proposing. No guarentees that I
have concordance :)
